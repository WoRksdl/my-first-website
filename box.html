     <p>I will always remerber.
   The day you kissed my lips.
    light as a feather. and it went just like this. No it's never been better. Than the summer of 2002.
    We were only eleven. But acting like grownups. Like we are in the present. Drinking from plastic cups. Singing love is forever and ever. Well I guess that was true. Dancing on the hoold in the middile of the woods. Of and old Mustang where we sang. Songs with all our childhoods friends. And it went like this yeah.
    Oops I got 99 problems singing bye bye bye. Hold up if you wanna go and take a ride with me. Vetter hit me baby one more time. Paint a picture for you and me. Of the days when we were young. Singing at the top of both our lungs. Now we're under the covers. Fast foward to eigteen. We are more than lovers. Ydah we are all we need. When we're hilding each other. I'm taken back to 2002. Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods. Of an old Mustang where we sang. Songs with all our childhoods friends. And it went like this yeah. Oops I got 99 problems singing bye bye bye. Hold up if you wana go and take a ride with me. Better hit me baby one more time. Paint a picture for you and me. Of the days when we were young. Singing at the top of both our lungs. On the day we fell in love. On the day we fell in love.
    Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods. Of an old Mustang where we sang. Song with all our childhoods friends. Oh now. Oops I got 99 problems singing bye bye bye. Hold up if you wanna go and take a ride with me.
    Better hit me baby one more time.
    Paint a picture for you and me. Of the days when we wre young. Singing at the top of both our lungs. 
    On the day we fell in love.On the day we fell in love.On the day we fell in love.On the day we fell in love.On the day we fell in love love love</p>
